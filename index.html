        <p>&nbsp; As a person, I have always been drawn to the weird side of reality,and sometimes even fiction.
      
By drawing i get to create some of that weird stuff, and during the pandemic, I've began to 
       use it as a way to not get too bored.
       I would recommend drawing for every one, even if they are not that good.
       If you looked at my old art and compared to my more recent art,you
      would see that I got better by time.
       <br>
       <br>
       That was my favorite hobby. What is yours? .</p>
